# Senior-Portfolio
A compilation of Computer Science projects I have worked on while being a student at Westminster.

### [Meme Generator (Fall 2018)](https://github.com/tiff9099/DBProject)
I worked on this project while in Databases. In this class, I learned a lot about databases from theory, practical design, implementation, and application programming using SQL. Thus, implementing this final project was helpful for me in ingraining the concepts and techniques I learned about database design and functionality. 

In this project, we created an application that has a meme generator and a homepage that displays the most liked/newest memes. The generator takes two strings for input: top text and bottom text and can return a random meme from the database. The meme is then generated with that text designated to   the image.  This web application functions in allowing users to create custom memes, vote for the best memes, and post comments. It also included functionality for a recommender system that displays memes to users in a personalized way.

This meme generator was coded in python3 using Django as its web framework. ImageMagick was used to manipulate the images and save them into our database. For the recommender system, we used a machine learning python package. 


### [Asteroids (Spring 2019)](https://github.com/tiff9099/Intro-to-Data-Structures/tree/master/Asteroids)
This was a final project I completed for Intro to Data Structures. Asteroids is a quite simple game that allows the player to control a
triangular shaped spaceship in an asteroid field. I had actually previously worked on this project in the Spring of 2018, freshman year of college. When I first attempted taking Data Structures, but working on this project was really difficult for me and I did not really understand how to apply the concepts and theories we had learned about data structures into this project, so I did not do well in implementing this project and in that class at that time in general. 

However, after re-taking this course again the next year really help me reaffirm to myself that I did actually understand the materials I was taught and had absorbed in Data Structures, but just needed more patience, support, and time to learn how to implement them correctly and effectively. Though this was not at all an easy process for me since I had to redo all the coursework I had previously struggled in completing before, I was able to get full points on my final version of this Asteroids project. All in all, this was a meaningful learning experience for me. 

### [Space Math (Spring 2019)](https://github.com/tiff9099/1st-2nd-Grade-Math-Game)
A web app to help elementary school students (grades 1 and 2) practice and improve their math skills. This game is built using ActionScript3 and the Starling framework as well as PHP and MySQL. Working on this project in a group setting was helpful in learning how to foster effective teamwork in software engineering work, which seems to be a good skill to have in the future if I were to land a software engineering job. 

This class was actually very interesting for me since I have yet to participate in a computer science related internship or job. I learned a lot about the different concepts of software engineering and techniques of software design, especially about the Agile technique of designing, developing, and delivering software. My teammates and I experienced several programming challenges which really challenged me to apply my problem solving skills to find a solution to overcome these unforseen challenges. In the end, we were able to overcome the majority of the challenges that were thrown at us and ultimately, reflect on how we could implement future software projects more effectively. 

### [Genre Prediction from IMDB Movie Posters Using a Multi-Label CNN](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17N2fQnXBbRnFydgC6Gu88RxlXX3QsddZ?usp=sharing)
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) that, given an image of a movie poster, it will output the top 3 genre predictions for that movie. This CNN is based off an existing multi-label image classifier model created by Prateek Joshi, which learns from a data set of 10,000 movie poster images and improves upon Joshi’s existing model by increasing its accuracy. After processing and cleaning the dataset, and implementing and tuning different architectures, we ended up with 91.97% accuracy, a significant improvement from Joshi’s model. However, greater accuracy could be achieved with higher computational resources and the implementation of regularization. 

In this deep learning project, we test the state-of-the-art architecture VGG19, and another supervised convolutional neural network, to perform the classification task of teaching our CNN how to identify different genres given a movie poster as input and output its top 3 associated genres. It does this by using this state-of-the-art model during training to encode input images with convolution, subsampling layers of the network and then using the SoftMax approach to calculate genre probability.  

Implementing this project was very significant for me in my learning process because it helped me get exposure to a field of knowledge, Deep Learning, that is not offered at Westminster and that I plan to use for implementing my Senior Capstone Project. Deep Learning is a field that I did not really know existed before this point in time, but that has become my interest area since completing this project, which involves implementing a CNN and various Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques. 

### [Senior Capstone (Spring 2020)]()
The focus of my senior capstone project is to create an unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that uses computer vision and pattern recognition techniques and algorithms to detect photosensitive images apart from non-photosensitive ones. As a photosensitive person, I want to implement this project in order to protect photosensitive online users from being unnecessarily triggered and harmed by photosensitive content due to the unavailability of settings to filter such content on popular online platforms (e.g. YouTube, Instagram, etc.) to accomodate photosensitive individuals. I will use a multi-label classifier to learn from a small image dataset containing a variety of both photosensitive and non-photosensitive images (tbd, approximately 1000-5000 images if possible) in order to train my CNN. This unsupervised CNN will be coded using Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. 

Though officially I have yet to implement this project, I believe that it will be an opportunity to display my individual codings abilities of designing, developing, and implementing a good performing CNN. Moreover, this project will have a social impact with the research and findings I will accomplish. My goal is to raise awareness in the tech industry for differently abled online users as this industry has tradionally left out such individuals when designing and creating online content and technological devices.
