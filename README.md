# Senior-Portfolio
A compilation of computer science projects I worked on during my time as an undergraduate student at Westminster College.

### [Meme Generator (Fall 2018)](https://github.com/tiff9099/DBProject) 
This was a final team project I collaboratively worked on with 2 other classmates in the course Database Systems. In this course, I learned about databases from theory, practical design, implementation, and application programming using SQL. I learned how to read, design, and interpret relational models for databases; to implement, query, and work with database systems; to design and write applications that interact with databases; and work collaboratively in teams to implement meaningful projects.

Implementing this final project was helpful for me in effectively applying the concepts and techniques I learned about database design and functionality in this course hands on in building an application that could be applicable to the real world. 

For this project, we created an application that had a meme generator and a homepage that displayed the most liked/newest memes. The generator took two strings for input: top text and bottom text and returned a random meme from the database. The meme was then generated with the text designated to the image. This web application functioned in allowing users to create custom memes, vote for the best memes, and post comments. It also included functionality for a recommender system that displayed memes to users in a personalized way. This meme generator was coded in python3 using Django as its web framework. ImageMagick was used to manipulate the images and save them into our database. As for the recommender system, we used a machine learning python package. 

Since this was my first time completing a web application, upon completing this project, I felt that I gained confidence in my ability to design and write web applications that interact with databases. In simple words, my proficiency in developing higher level software grew. It challenged me to think more about the immense amount of possibilities and creations that could be made with object-oriented and database systems like SQL. It was thought-provoking and made me reflect on how much creativity and collaboration it takes for developers all around the world to create applications and platforms that positively influence the livelihoods of potentially billions of people. 

### [Asteroids (Spring 2019)](https://github.com/tiff9099/Intro-to-Data-Structures/tree/master/Asteroids)
Asteroids was my final project I completed for an Intro to Data Structures course. Asteroids is a simple game that allows a player to control a triangular shaped spaceship in an asteroid field. To be honest, I had previously worked on this project, one year before, in the Spring of 2018, during my freshman year of college. I first attempted taking the Intro to Data Structures then, but working on this project was really difficult for me at the time since I did not yet comprehensively understand how to apply the concepts and theories we learned about data structures to implement this project. It was the second computer science course I had ever taken, so my grasp on computer science and coding in general were still at a newcomer's level. Therefore, in my first attempt, I did not do well in implementing this project and the class overall. 

Although my first year in computer science was discouraging, I did not give up, but instead, perservered. I did my best in learning more about Java programming and read through textbooks throughout the Summer of 2018 to make up for my shortcomings. I was then able to re-take this course again the next year in the Spring of 2019. Although for some re-taking a course may seem like a weakness, I found that re-taking this course really help me understand data structures more intimately and more firmly establish the important structures and algorithms taught in my mind. It helped me reaffirm to myself how much I actually understood about the materials I was taught and had absorbed in Data Structures, but just needed more patience, support, and time to learn how to implement them correctly and effectively. Though this was not at all an easy process for me, since I had to redo all the coursework I had previously struggled in completing before, I was able to get full points on my final version of this Asteroids project and truly understand the importance of the application of data structures in the world of technology, from games like Asteroids to webpages on Google. All in all, this was a meaningful learning experience for me since this was the first significant project I successfully implemented on my own. 

### [Space Math (Spring 2019)](https://github.com/tiff9099/1st-2nd-Grade-Math-Game)
This was a semester-long project I helped develop in a group setting for an upper-level computer science Software Engineering course. In Software Engineering, we focused on effectively creating software using an Agile approach to software development and design. We extensively learned about software engineering techniques and practices such as software planning and design, scheduling, testing and reliability, and software main-tenance. 

Space Math was a web app created to help elementary school students (grades 1 and 2) practice and improve their math skills. This game was built using ActionScript3 and the Starling framework as well as PHP and MySQL. This project was completed within 3 releases (January-April) and mimiced the actual process of software design and development many tech companies use. We proposed an initial prototype and then were able to successfully present and model our final product release. 

Working on this project in a group setting was helpful in learning how to foster effective teamwork in software engineering work, which seems to be a good skill to have in the future if I were to land a software engineering job. 

This class was very fascinating for me since I have yet to participate in a computer science related internship or job at this point in time. I learned a lot about the different concepts of software engineering and techniques of software design, especially about the Agile technique of designing, developing, and delivering software. My teammates and I experienced several programming challenges which really challenged me to apply my problem solving skills to find a solution to overcome these unforseen challenges. In the end, we were able to overcome the majority of the challenges that were thrown at us and ultimately, reflect on how we could implement future software projects more effectively. 

### [Genre Prediction from IMDB Movie Posters Using a Multi-Label CNN](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17N2fQnXBbRnFydgC6Gu88RxlXX3QsddZ?usp=sharing)
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) that, given an image of a movie poster, it will output the top 3 genre predictions for that movie. This CNN is based off an existing multi-label image classifier model created by Prateek Joshi, which learns from a data set of 10,000 movie poster images and improves upon Joshi’s existing model by increasing its accuracy. After processing and cleaning the dataset, and implementing and tuning different architectures, we ended up with 91.97% accuracy, a significant improvement from Joshi’s model. However, greater accuracy could be achieved with higher computational resources and the implementation of regularization. 

In this deep learning project, we test the state-of-the-art architecture VGG19, and another supervised convolutional neural network, to perform the classification task of teaching our CNN how to identify different genres given a movie poster as input and output its top 3 associated genres. It does this by using this state-of-the-art model during training to encode input images with convolution, subsampling layers of the network and then using the SoftMax approach to calculate genre probability.  

Implementing this project was very significant for me in my learning process because it helped me get exposure to a field of knowledge, Deep Learning, that is not offered at Westminster and that I plan to use for implementing my Senior Capstone Project. Deep Learning is a field that I did not really know existed before this point in time, but that has become my interest area since completing this project, which involves implementing a CNN and various Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques. 

### [Senior Capstone (Spring 2021)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13wdpMhF30MCD5fsvj3MXiKdINBrQC55x#scrollTo=YJ4RROkWvH49)
The focus of my senior capstone project is to create an unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that uses computer vision and pattern recognition techniques and algorithms to detect photosensitive images apart from non-photosensitive ones. As a photosensitive person, I want to implement this project in order to protect photosensitive online users from being unnecessarily triggered and harmed by photosensitive content due to the unavailability of settings to filter such content on popular online platforms (e.g. YouTube, Instagram, etc.) to accomodate photosensitive individuals. I will use a multi-label classifier to learn from a small image dataset containing a variety of both photosensitive and non-photosensitive images (tbd, approximately 1000-5000 images if possible) in order to train my CNN. This unsupervised CNN will be coded using Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. 

Though officially I have yet to implement this project, I believe that it will be an opportunity to display my individual codings abilities of designing, developing, and implementing a good performing CNN. Moreover, this project will have a social impact with the research and findings I will accomplish. My goal is to raise awareness in the tech industry for differently abled online users as this industry has tradionally left out such individuals when designing and creating online content and technological devices.
